# Gesture_Recognition_System
Overview
This project aims to develop a Hand Gesture Recognition System using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system can recognize and interpret hand gestures captured through a camera, enabling users to interact with devices or applications through gestures.

Features
Real-time Recognition: The system performs hand gesture recognition in real-time, enabling interactive applications.
Multiple Gestures: Recognizes a variety of hand gestures, such as thumbs up, peace sign, pointing, etc.
Custom Gestures: Allows users to define and train custom gestures for specific applications or commands.
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing detected gestures and their corresponding actions.
